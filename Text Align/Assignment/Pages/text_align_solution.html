  <h1>Pikachu</h1>  
  <h3>Power: Electric Type</h3>
  <p>Pikachu is a small, chubby, and incredibly cute mouse-like Pok√©mon which is covered almost completely by yellow fur. 
      It has long yellow ears that are tipped with black. A Pikachu's back has two brown stripes, and its large tail is notable for being shaped 
      like a lightning bolt. On its cheeks are two circle-shaped red pouches used for storing electricity, they turn yellow and spark with 
      electricity when its about to use an Electric attack such as Thunderbolt. A female Pikachu looks almost exactly the same as a male, 
      with the exception of her tail. A female Pikachu's tail is rounded at the end and has an inward dent, giving it the 
      appearance of a heart.</p>
