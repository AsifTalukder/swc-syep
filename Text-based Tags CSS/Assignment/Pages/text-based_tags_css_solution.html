            Although the information is easily accessible, not much has been revealed about Morty's past life. Currently, Morty is 14 years old, and as of the beginning of the series, Rick Sanchez had been mysteriously missing from the family for a total of 14 years. It is unknown if Morty's birth and Rick's disappearance are linked to each other, but it has been shown on two separate occasions that Rick knew Morty when he was only a baby. In the episode "Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind", one of Rick's happy memories of Morty was picking him up as a baby. In the episode "Get Schwifty", a picture on Birdperson's wall depicted Rick holding a baby, who, although had an ambiguous identity, was very likely Morty at that same age.

        <p id="appearanceP">
            Morty is a young teenage boy. He has short brown hair that he wears straight and neatly combed around his head. Morty's head is round and roughly in the shape and size of a circle, unlike many other characters in the show. He also doesn't have a visible neck. He typically wears a yellow shirt, blue pants, and white shoes. Morty also has a pronounced stutter (even when calm) and his voice constantly breaks due his effects of puberty.
