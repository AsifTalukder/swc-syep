    <h2 align="center">About me</h2>
    <p align="center">
        I am the main protagonist and one of the five main characters of The Simpsons. 
        I am the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. 
        I am overweight (~240 pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around me. 
        Although I have many flaws, I have shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those I cares about and, sometimes, even others I don't.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        My favorite color is blue and I enjoy dancing, eating donuts, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade racer, playing the piano and horse riding. 
        My favorite kiddie rides are "Stuart Little", "Barney Train" and "Ride the Champion Mechanical Horse".
