        <p class="forParagraph">
            South Park is an American animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and developed by Brian Graden for Comedy Central. 
            The series revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their exploits in and around the titular Colorado town. 
            South Park became infamous for its profanity and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics towards an adult audience.

            Parker and Stone developed South Park from two animated short films both titled The Spirit of Christmas. 
            The second short became one of the first Internet viral videos, ultimately leading to South Park's production. 
            The pilot episode was produced using cutout animation, leading to all subsequent episodes being produced with computer animation that emulated the cutout technique. 
            South Park features a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters.

            Since its debut on August 13, 1997, 309 episodes of South Park have been broadcast. 
            It debuted with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program. 
            Subsequent ratings have varied, but it remains one of Comedy Central's highest-rated programs and is slated to air new episodes through 2022. 
            Since 2000, each episode has typically been written and produced in the week preceding its broadcast, with Parker serving as the primary writer and director. 
            Two television specials, "The Pandemic Special" and "South ParQ Vaccination Special", respectively premiered in September 2020 and March 2021.
