            <p>Pikachu is a small, chubby, and incredibly cute mouse-like Pokémon which is covered almost completely by yellow fur. 
                It has long yellow ears that are tipped with black. A Pikachu's back has two brown stripes, and its large tail is notable for being shaped 
                like a lightning bolt. On its cheeks are two circle-shaped red pouches used for storing electricity, they turn yellow and spark with 
                electricity when its about to use an Electric attack such as Thunderbolt. A female Pikachu looks almost exactly the same as a male, 
                with the exception of her tail. A female Pikachu's tail is rounded at the end and has an inward dent, giving it the 
                appearance of a heart.</p>

            <p>Gengar is a shadow-like, round-bodied Pokémon with two large, pointed ears and short spikes lining its back. 
                Gengar has two red eyes and a toothy, sinister smile. It has claws on its hands. Gengar stands on its two short legs, 
                but it can Levitate as well.</p>

            <p>Luxray resembles a fully-grown lion with a black and blue coat and a spiked mane. Black fur covers most of its body except the backs of its legs, 
                midsection and some of its face. It has light-blue legs with three yellow rings on the front legs. 
                On its rear is a spiked tuft of fur. Its tail ends in a golden star. It has red scleras and golden irises and pupils.</p>
